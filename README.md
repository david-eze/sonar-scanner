## Sonar Scanner
**`Arduino-based sonar scanner using an ultrasonic sensor and servo to map surroundings.`**

### 🔍 Overview


### 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO: To control the sonar scanning system by reading sensor data, processing it, and triggering the actuator; the servo.
- C++ : The programming language to write the code.
- Passive Buzzer: Used to make a sound whenever an object approaches the ultrasonic sensor.
- RGB LED: Lights up when an object is extremely close to the ultrasonic sensor.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: Measure distances based on transmitting and receiving ultrasonic signals.
- Breadboard: Hosts multiple components and facilitates the creation of a temporary circuit.
- Jumper wires: Connects the different components.
- Resistors: Limits the current flow to prevent damage to components.
